# Resume Matching with Job Descriptions using spaCy and TF-IDF

# Overview

This project is a simple yet effective Resume Matching System that extracts keywords from resumes and job descriptions to determine the best candidate for a given job. It utilizes spaCy for natural language processing and TF-IDF vectorization to compute similarity scores. The project is designed for HR professionals and individuals to quickly assess which skills best match a job description.
